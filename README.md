# Drim Game 2022

## Context and Purpose of the project


## Structure of the repository

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `basic_exploration` | First exploration |
| `datas` | Differents data sources |
| `DreamLib` | Python scripts used in the Notebook |
| `notebooks` | Jupyter Notebooks |

## DreamLib structure

| Files | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `construction_DreamLib.py` | notebook used to construct the scripts |
| `linear_models.py` | contains the regression functions for the prediction |
| `processing_datas.py` | contains the preprocessing functions to clean the datas |
| `timeseries.py` | models based on the timeseries theory |
| `visualization.py` | functions to plot the datas |
